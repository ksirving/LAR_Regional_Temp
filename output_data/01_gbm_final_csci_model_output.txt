Performing cross-validation optimisation of a boosted regression tree model 
for Score and using a family of gaussian 
Using 12370 observations and 17 predictors 
creating 10 initial models of 100 trees 

 folds are unstratified 
total mean deviance =  0.0562 
tolerance is fixed at  1e-04 
now adding trees...
